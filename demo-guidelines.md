# Demo guidelines

I will briefly go over the main thought process of how I think the video should be structured.

## Introduction

When thinking about a demo the first thing that comes to your mind is **what** you are building.
That should also be the first thing to tell (or show) the audience.
For example:

1. Integromat
   - Situation - I am building an Integromat integration with NEAR. So the users can interact with NEAR using my app, what is the simplest way for them to see that it is useful?
   - Story - I am a developer who wants to get notified when NEAR changes their protocol version so that I can update my other apps. How can I do that?
  
2. Adalo
   - Situation - I am building an Adalo integration with NEAR. So the users can interact with NEAR using the components I created, what is the simplest way for them to see that it is useful?
   - Story - I am a developer who doesn't want to build all the logic and spend time investigating the protocol. How can I integrate with NEAR?

## The solution

The next thing we want to do is present the user with a solution to their problem.
This is the **how** part.
So we show them a working example or a short walkthrough of how to use our project.
For example:

1. Integromat
   - Show the user a basic scenario with everything set up.

2. Adalo
   - Show the user how to add a connect to wallet button to their app

## The demonstration

After the solution is presented, you should show the user how it works.
For example:

1. Integromat
   - Run the scenario and show the output

2. Adalo
   - Open the app and connect to the wallet with a single click

## Conclusion

The final part is wrapping up with some other example ideas.
Maybe telling the user something in the neighborhood of:

> This is just a smiple demo of what you can do, you can also do: (send money, call a view function, etc.)

Any example ideas you think would be best suited for the target audience (e.g. the developers of the platform you are integrating with).
